Complexity:
- Hash Table
Hash tables offer O(1) average-case complexity for search, insertion, and deletion, 
making them extremely fast when the hash function distributes keys evenly. 
However, in the worst-case (e.g., many collisions), performance degrades to O(n).

- Tree
Tree-based structures, like tries, have O(m) complexity for search and insertion, 
where m is the length of the key. 
They are slower than hash tables in general but provide consistent worst-case performance, 
unaffected by collisions.

However,

./t27
Execution time: 0.050855 seconds

./ext
Execution time: 4.229095 seconds


The hash table execution time was 5.514978 seconds, 
significantly slower than the tree structureâ€™s 0.097086 seconds. 
While hash tables theoretically offer O(1) complexity for average cases, 
several practical factors can lead to slower performance:
1. Collision handling inefficiencies.
2. Hash function computational cost.
3. Poor memory/cache utilization.
4. Excessive rehashing due to inadequate initial settings.
5. Key distribution issues.

For large datasets or unknown key distributions, 
trees may perform better due to their stability and reduced reliance on specific configurations. 
To improve hash table performance, may consider:
- Using a faster hash function.
- Increasing the initial capacity to reduce collisions.
- Tailoring the hash function to the key distribution.

After Increasing the initial capacity, which set TABLE_SIZE from 10 to 1000, 
the execution time decreased significantly.
Execution time: 0.065270 seconds.

CPU Percentage:
./ext: 91% (TABLE_SIZE:1000)
./t27: 96%

Memory usage:
./ext: 10,868KB (TABLE_SIZE:1000)
./t27: 44,956KB

Page Faults:
./ext: 2,377
./t27: 10,963

In conclusion, 
- Speed: ./t27 is slightly faster than ./ext in terms of elapsed time and user time.
- Memory Usage: ./t27 uses more memory, possibly due to larger data structures or more intensive processing.
- Efficiency: While both programs utilize a high percentage of CPU, 
./t27 has more page faults and a larger memory footprint, 
which could affect its scalability or performance in memory-constrained environments.
