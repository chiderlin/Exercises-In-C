The code compiled without errors or warnings. Overall, the code is concise. The use of default functions like isdigit and islower for checks is quite good. There aren't many variable names in the code, and most calculations are done in a single line. Lines 7-11 should be indented more than line 6, and line 13 should be indented more than line 12 for better alignment. The code includes "magic numbers"; defining values like 13, 26, 5, and 10 would improve clarity. No additional custom functions were used to handle parts of the program. In terms of testing, there are simple tests for alpha and digit conversion, but no special handling for symbols or mixed inputs. The use of MAIN or CAPS was not observed. Overall, I would give it a score of 51%.
