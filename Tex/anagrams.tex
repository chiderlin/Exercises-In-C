\nsection{Anagrams}

An anagram is a collection of letters that
when unscrambled, using all the letters, make
a single word. For instance \verb^magrana^ can
be rearranged to make the word \verb^anagram^.

\begin{exercise}
Using a file of valid words, allow the user
to enter an anagram, and have the answer(s)
printed. For instance~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
 % ./anagram sternaig
angriest
astringe
ganister
gantries
ingrates
rangiest
reasting
stearing
\end{terminaloutput}

An anagram is defined here to be a {\em different} word, so if a valid word is 
entered, it itself is not reported, e.g.~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
 % ./anagram pots
tops
stop
opts
spot
post
\end{terminaloutput}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Using a file of valid words, find all
words which are anagrams of each other.
Each word should appear in a maximum of one list.
Output will look something like~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
 % ./selfanagram
.
.
7 merits mister miters mitres remits smiter timers
.
.
.
6 noters stoner tenors tensor toners trones
.
.
.
6 opts post pots spot stop tops
.
.
.
6 restrain retrains strainer terrains trainers transire
.
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}

If you wished to create ``interesting'' anagrams, rather than simply
a random jumble of letters, you could combine together two
shorter words which are an anagram of a longer one.

\begin{exercise}
Write a program which uses an exhaustive
search of all the possible pairs of short words to make the target word
to be computed.
For instance, a few of the many pairs that
can be used to make an anagram of \verb^compiler^ are~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
 % ./teabreak compiler
LiceRomp
LimeCrop
LimpCore
MileCrop
MoreClip
PermCoil
PromLice
RelicMop
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}

The name \verb^Campbell^ comes out as \verb^CalmPleb^ which is a
bit harsh. Can't {\bf ever} remember being called calm ...
