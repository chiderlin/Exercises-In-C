\nsection{A Simple Spelling Checker}

Here, we reads words one at a time
from file and carefully place them in the {\bf correct} part of
our data structure. This has a complexity of $O(n^2)$.

For this purpose, a list of valid words (unsorted) is available
from \verb^github : Data/Words^.

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:arrayinsertsort}
Write a program which, based on a
fixed-size {\bf array} of strings, reads the words in
one at a time, inserting them into the {\bf correct} part of the array
so that the words are alphabetically sorted.
The name of the file should be passed as \verb^argv[1]^,
and you can assume the array is large enough to hold all words.
How long does it take to build the list~?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:linearsearch}
Now extend Exercise~\ref{ex:arrayinsertsort}
so that when the user is prompted for a word,
they are told whether this word is present in the array or not.
Use a {\em Linear Search} for this: start at the beginning of the
list and work your way through it one word at a time.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:binarysearch}
Extend Exercise~\ref{ex:linearsearch} using a
{\em Binary Search} for this.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:linkedinsertsort}
Write a program which, based on a
linked list data structure, reads the words in
one at a time, inserting them into the {\bf correct} part of the list
so that the words are alphabetically sorted.
The name of the file should be passed as \verb^argv[1]^.
