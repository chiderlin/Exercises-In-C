\nsection{Merging Strings}

\begin{exercise}
Write the function \verb^strmerge()^ which concatenates \verb^s1^ and \verb^s2^ into \verb^s3^,
discarding any overlapping characters which are common to the end (tail) of \verb^s1^ and the 
beginning (head) of \verb^s2^.
To help, I've put some skeleton code in the usual place online.

Hint : Functions such as \verb^strncmp()^ and \verb^strcat^ might be useful.
