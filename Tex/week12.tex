\begin{exercise}
Implement a teletext rendering system. The $1000$ character input
file should be read in using \verb^argv[1]^.

There are many ambiguities
as to how various sequences of codes should be rendered. To help with
this, several example files have been posted on the unit web page. 
If there is still doubt, make a best-guess and state your assumptions
in the code.

Submit the testing you have undertaken, including examples and a description
of your strategies. This should convince us that you have tested every line
of code, and that it works correctly. If there are still issues/bugs state
them clearly. Also, point out any bugs that you have successfully found using
these approaches. Submit a file named \verb^testing.txt^, along with any other
files you feel necessary in the appropriate directory.

No particular strategy is mandated. You may wish to explore a couple and briefly
discuss strengths and weaknesses. 

Undertake an extension of your choosing. Examples of these include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A system that allows you to quickly author teletext pages (perhaps
using a recursive-descent parser?)
\item Automatic image to teletext conversion.
\item Automatic (simple) html to teletext conversion (and/or vice-versa).
\end{itemize}
Remember, that the assessment is based on the quality of your coding, so choose
something to demonstrate an aspect of programming or software engineering
that you haven't had a chance to use in the main assignment. Submit a file named
\verb^extension.txt^ outlining, in brief, your contribution. 

\subsection*{Hints}

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't add graphics too early - the
code is easier to test and debug with textual output to begin with.
\item I advise you to use SDL for your graphics output. The library provided previously contained
two functions to deal with printing characters~: \verb^Neill_SDL_ReadFont()^ and
\verb^Neill_SDL_DrawString()^. The font file \verb^m7fixed.fnt^ provides the basic
characters required here, but not the sixels. By understanding how the font data
is rendered, the double height version of the characters should be relatively simple.
\item Don't try to do all aspects of this at once - begin with coloured characters only. Add more
advanced functionality later.
\item Plan how you are going to store your data early in the design process.
Does each character need its own data structure? Does each line? Can this be abstracted?
\end{itemize}

Please create a directory structure, so that I can easily find the
different subsections.  Your testing strategy will be explained in
\verb^testing.txt^, and your extension as \verb^extension.txt^. For
the source and extension sections, make sure there's a
\verb^Makefile^, so that I can easily build the code.

\begin{verbatim}
            ------Top Directory------
            |            |          |           
            |            |          |           
            |            |          |            
            |            |          |             
          source      testing    extension   
            |            |          |
           ...          ...   extension.txt
           ...          ...       ...
         Makefile     Makefile    ...  
                    testing.txt
\end{verbatim}

Bundle all of these up as one {\bf single} \verb^.zip^ submission -
not one for each subsection.

From \wwwurl{http://gvr.sourceforge.net/}
{\small
\begin{quote}
Guido van Robot can face in one of four directions, north, east, south, and west. He turns only 90 degrees at a time, so he can't face northeast, for instance. In Guido's world, streets run east-west, and are numbered starting at 1. There are no zero or negative street numbers. Avenues run north-south, and are also numbered starting at 1, with no zero or negative avenue numbers. At the intersection of a street and avenue is a corner. Guido moves from one corner to the next in a single movement. Because he can only face in one of four directions, when he moves he changes his location by one avenue, or by one street, but not both!

\subsection*{The Formal Grammar}
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
<PROGRAM>   ::= <BLOCK>
<BLOCK>     ::= "turnoff" |
                "move" <BLOCK> |
                "turnleft" <BLOCK> |
                "pickbeeper" <BLOCK> |
                "putbeeper" <BLOCK> |
                <DO> <BLOCK> |
                <WHILE> <BLOCK> |
                <IF> <BLOCK>
<DO>        ::= "do" <num> ":"
                   <BLOCK>
<WHILE>     ::= "while" <TEST> ":"
                   <BLOCK>
<IF>        ::= "if" <TEST> ":"
                   <BLOCK> |
              "if" <TEST> ":"
                   <BLOCK>
              "else" ":"
                   <BLOCK>
<TEST>      ::= <WALL> | <BEEP> | <COMPASS>
\end{verbatim}
}

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
<WALL>      ::= "front_is_clear" |
                "front_is_blocked" |
                "left_is_clear" |
                "left_is_blocked" |
                "right_is_clear" |
                "right_is_blocked"
<BEEP>      ::= "next_to_a_beeper" |
                "not_next_to_a_beeper" |
                "any_beepers_in_beeper_bag" |
                "no_beepers_in_beeper_bag"
<COMPASS>   ::= "facing_north" |
                "not_facing_north" |
                "facing_south" |
                "not_facing_south" |
                "facing_east" |
                "not_facing_east" |
                "facing_west" |
                "not_facing_west"
\end{verbatim}
}

This ignores some Guido instructions, e.g. \verb^elseif^
and \verb^define^. It also doesn't well explain how to spot
the end of a \verb^DO^ etc. which is marked by a reduction in
indentation.
The definition of \verb^.wld^ files is so simple a recursive
descent parser (and hence grammar) is not required.

\begin{exercise}
\begin{itemize}

\item (25\%) To implement a recursive descent parser - this says
whether or not the given \verb^.gvr^ and \verb^.wld^ follow the formal grammar or not.
The input files are specified via \verb^argv[1]^ (\verb^.gvr^) and \verb^argv[2]^ (\verb^.wld^) .

\item (25\%) To implement an interpreter, so that the instructions are
executed. Printing the world and robot to screen
using simple characters is fine, but many will wish to use SDL.

\item (25\%) To show a testing strategy on the above -
you should give details of
white-box and black-box testing done on your code. Describe any
test-harnesses used. Give examples of the output of many different
programs. Convince me that every line of your C code
has been tested.

\item (25\%) To show an extension to the project in a direction of
your choice. It should demonstrate your understanding of some aspect
of programming or S/W engineering. If you extend the formal grammar
make sure that you show the new, full grammar.

Submit the program(s) and a Makefile so that I can:

\item Compile the parser by typing `make parse'.
\item Compile the interpreter by typing `make interp'.
\item Compile the extension by typing `make extension'.
\item Submit a test strategy report called test.txt. This will include
sample outputs, any code written especially for testing etc.
\item Submit an extension report called `extend.txt'. This is quite
brief and explains the extension attempted.

\item You need to be able to load a world file and a \verb^.gvr^
and say if they are valid of not.
\item Don't try to write the entire program in one go. Try a cut
down version of the grammar first, e.g.:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
<PROGRAM>   ::= <BLOCK>
<BLOCK>     ::= "turnoff" |
                "move" <BLOCK> |
                "turnleft" <BLOCK> |
                "pickbeeper" <BLOCK> |
                "putbeeper" <BLOCK>
<DO>        ::= "do" <num> ":"
                   <BLOCK>
\end{verbatim}
}
\item Some issues, such as what happens if you hit a wall
are not clear from the formal grammar. In this case, use your
common sense, or do what the real program does.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}


\input{nlab}

\input{cawk}

\begin{exercise}
Write a C program to implement the above formal grammar. Your program
should read in a cawk program (argv[1]) and expect the data
file to be read from standard input (or from argv[2] if specified).

The marks are split as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item (25\%) To implement a recursive descent parser - this says
whether or not a given CAWK program follows the formal grammar or not.

\item (25\%) To implement an interpreter, so that the instructions are
executed.

\item (25\%) To show a testing strategy on the above -
you should give details of
white-box and black-box testing done on your code. Describe any
test-harnesses used. Give examples of the output of many different
cawk programs.

\item (25\%) To show an extension to the project in a direction of
your choice. It should demonstrate your understanding of some aspect
of programming or S/W engineering. If you extend the formal grammar
make sure that you show the new, full grammar.
\end{itemize}

Submit the program(s) and a Makefile so that I can:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compile the parser by typing `make parse'.
\item Compile the interpreter by typing `make interp'.
\item Compile the extension by typing `make extension'.
\end{itemize}

In addition:
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit a test strategy report called test.txt. This will include
sample outputs, any code written especially for testing etc.
\item Submit an extension report called `extend.txt'. This is quite
brief and explains the extension attempted.
\end{itemize}

\end{exercise}

\input{nal}
\begin{exercise}
\begin{itemize}

\strut

\item {\bf (40\%)}
Implement a parser. The \verb^.nal^ file should be read in using
\verb^argv[1]^.  If the file is parsed correctly, the only output should
be:
\begin{terminaloutput}
Parsed OK
\end{terminaloutput}

\item {\bf (30\%)}
Implement an interpreter, building on top of the parser in the
manner described in the lectures. Do not write a brand new program -
interpretation will be done alongside parsing.

\item {\bf (20\%)}
Submit the testing you have undertaken, including examples and a
description of your strategies. This should convince us that you have
tested every line of code, and that it works correctly. If there are
still issues/bugs state them clearly. Also, point out any bugs that
you have successfully found using these approaches. Submit a file named
\verb^testing.txt^, along with any other files you feel necessary. Due
to the recursive nature of this assignment testing is non-trivial -
simply submitting many \verb^.nal^ files that `work' is not sufficient.
No particular strategy is mandated. You may wish to explore a couple
and briefly discuss strengths and weaknesses.

\item {\bf (10\%)}
Undertake an extension of your choosing.  Remember, that the assessment is
based on the quality of your coding, so choose something to demonstrate
an aspect of programming or software engineering that you haven't
had a chance to use in the main assignment. Submit a file named
\verb^extension.txt^ outlining, in brief, your contribution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Don't try to write the entire program in one go. Try a cut
down version of the grammar first. Build-up from the \verb^01s^
example given in lectures.
\item Some issues, such as what happens if you use an undefined variable,
or if you use a variable before it is set, are not explained by the formal
grammar. Use your own common-sense, and explain what you have done.
\item Once your parser works, extend it to become an interpreter. DO NOT
aim to parse the program first and then interpret it separately.
Interpreting and parsing are inseparably bound together.
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection*{Submission}

Your testing strategy will be explained in \verb^testing.txt^, and
your extension as \verb^extension.txt^. For the parser, interpreter
and extension sections , make sure there's one \verb^Makefile^, so that I
can easily build the code using \verb^make parse^, \verb^make interp^
and \verb^make extension^. I've given an example \verb^makefile^ in the
usual place, but this is an example only - yours may be different.
I wrote only one program \verb^nal.c^ and built the two
different version by setting a \verb^#define^ {\bf via the makefile with}
\verb^-DINTERP^. Inside the code itself \verb^#ifdef INTERP^ and \verb^#endif^ are used.
Also make sure that basic testing is available using \verb^make testparse^ and \verb^make testinterp^.

\noindent Place all the files required for your submission in a single \verb^.zip^ file called \verb^nal.zip^ - this file will not contain other zipped files.
